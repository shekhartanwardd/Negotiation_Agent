OVERVIEW: Optimal Credit Amount

We have added the  Optimal Credit Amount field to the Order Resolution Tool (ORT).

- This field will recommend the best apology credit amount to offer the Consumer.
- This will help reduce C&R issuance while maintaining an exceptional Consumer experience!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
1. If I see the “Optimal Credit Amount” field, am I required to offer apology credits?

NO. Only offer apology credits if all of the following requirements are met:
- You have already offered C&R aligned with our policy (e.g., you selected the issue in ORT and offered the C&R amount that the tool permits)
- The Consumer is very unhappy with the C&R offered
- The situation warrants more compensation (e.g., You know the Cx had an extremely bad experience, and the C&R policy is insulting or unfair).

2. Am I allowed to issue more than the Optimal Credit Amount?
YES. We are not making changes to the maximum amount. You are allowed to issue more than the suggested amount if you tried offering the suggested amount, but the Cx explicitly states that they want more C&R.

Cx might say: 
- "Can I at least get some extra credits to cover the delivery costs of my re-order?"
- “That’s not enough money! Do you think $5.00 in apology credits is going to fix this?! I need a full refund for the missing item!”

3. Will I be able to issue apology credits to abusers?
- NO. Please continue to kindly deny C&R to abusers.

4. Why would the Optimal Credit Amount show $0.00?
- This means that the Optimal Credit Amount has already been issued by another Teammate. Although you are able to issue more apology credits, we advise against issuing more.
